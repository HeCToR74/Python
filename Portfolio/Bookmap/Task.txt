Data Analyst Assignment

The test
Assume that the attached data was retrieved from an actual website serving our business (it is not, 
but anyway). Provide some observations and suggestions that would help to advance the business.
The environment
Visitors visit our webpage. The page contains a section which shows cards with testimonials of our 
clients. In total we have X (~100) testimonials but the page displays a small number of cards, 
selected randomly for each visitor. The visitors may or may not view the testimonials section. 
Eventually, visitors leave the page by either clicking on something, or by closing the page. 
Some of these outcomes are more positive than others from a business perspective.
The data
The data is a collection of JSON objects where each object represents an event and has the following 
fields:

●	The type of the event
●	The timestamp of the event. Assume that this field has no impact on anything
●	A unique visitor id (there is no record that allows to identify returning visitors)
●	Optionally additional data that describes the event (feel free to ask if you need more 
details on specific events)
